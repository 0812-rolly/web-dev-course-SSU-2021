2. ### Stay in the middle of screen until the first set of pipes appears. 
The faster you tap, the higher you go. Each tap represents a wing flap and higher flight. Once you stop, you drop towards the ground.

3. ### Stay in the middle of the pipes.
This is the main objective of the game. If you hit a pipe or the ground, the game ends.

4. ### Find your rhythm for higher and lower pipes.
This is important when you need to go higher or drop, or else you will hit a pipe.
